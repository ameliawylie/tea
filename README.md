# üçµ Tea ‚Äî a better twitter experience.

üçµ Tea is a small extension which aims to add some extra features to the new Twitter UI.

It's also aimed at making things safer for people using Twitter, as muting a user does not actually remove them from your timeline.

## Features

- Force "Latest Tweets" to be on by default. Every time you open the Home tab, this extension will switch you back to Latest Tweets if set.
- Remove specific elements (Messages, Explore, Bookmarks, Lists, Trends and Who to Follow can all be removed).
- Hide "liked by" tweets from your timeline entirely.
- Hide "followed by" tweets from your timeline, too!
- Hide all tweets from a specific user from your timeline, regardless of source.
- Hide Promoted tweets by default.

## Caveats

Note that this extension currently only works if you are using Twitter in English.
This is because it uses accessibility labels where possible, but Twitter has a few places where it does not have these and Tea has to guess things based on the text used.
